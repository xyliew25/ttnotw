00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:28.700
The giant Rukmuka enters right. Walking with slow and heavy 
steps, he trembles frightfully, brimming with vigour. On the 
gong stroke that concludes the ﬁrst gong phrase of 
<em>Guntur</em>, the dhalang presses Rukmuka against the 
screen in the right gawang. Rukmuka sits down  and strokes 
his shock of hair.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.800
Rukmuka’s younger brother Rukmakala appears from the 
left, his right hand on his loincloth. He advances to 
the centre and nods to Rukmuka, who extends his arm 
in greeting. Rukmakala nods again, grabs his brother’s 
hand, and shakes it.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:51.700
Rukmakala sits down opposite Rukmuka and puts his hand 
in his lap.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:18.400
By means of a dhodhogan pattern, the dhalang cues the 
gamelan to accelerate and proceed to a slow pianissimo.
